          My name is Cat, and I have recently completed the Software Systems
          Developer certificate program at BCIT. The SSD program covered all the
          fundamentals and more, whether it was learning Javascript and C# to
          mastering frameworks like React and Angular. The SSD program also
          emphasized the importance of teamwork, communication, and
          problem-solving â€“ all critical skills for a successful career in web
          development.

          As I embark on the next phase of my journey, I am excited to bring my
          newly acquired skills to the workplace as a junior web developer. I am
          eager to collaborate with other developers and contribute to
          meaningful projects and grow my skills as a developer.
